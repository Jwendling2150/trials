The DM rolls d100 and consults the table.</p>\n<table border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Familiarity</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Mishap</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Similar Area</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Off Target</strong></td>\n<td><strong>On Target</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Permanent circle</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>01-100</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Associated object</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>01-100</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Very familiar</td>\n<td>01-05</td>\n<td>06-13</td>\n<td>14-24</td>\n<td>25-100</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Seen casually</td>\n<td>01-33</td>\n<td>34-43</td>\n<td>44-53</td>\n<td>54-100</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Viewed once</td>\n<td>01-43</td>\n<td>44-53</td>\n<td>54-73</td>\n<td>74-100</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Description</td>\n<td>01-43</td>\n<td>44-53</td>\n<td>54-73</td>\n<td>74-100</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>False destination</td>\n<td>01-50</td>\n<td>51-100</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><strong>Familiarity</strong>. \"Permanent circle\" means a permanent Teleportation Circle whose sigil sequence you know. \"Associated object\" means that you possess an object taken from the desired destination within the last six months, such as a book from a wizard's library, bed linen from a royal suite, or a chunk of marble from a lich's Secret tomb.</p><p>\"Very familiar\" is a place you have been very often, a place you have carefully studied, or a place you can see when you cast the spell. \"Seen casually\" is someplace you have seen more than once but with which you aren't very familiar. \"Viewed once\" is a place you have seen once, possibly using magic. \"Description\" is a place whose location and appearance you know through someone else's description, perhaps from a map.</p><p>\"False destination\" is a place that doesn't exist. Perhaps you tried to scry an enemy's sanctum but instead viewed an illusion, or you are attempting to teleport to a familiar location that no longer exists.</p><p><strong>On Target</strong>. You and your group (or the target object) appear where you want to.</p><p><strong>Off Target</strong>. You and your group (or the target object) appear a random distance away from the destination in a random direction. Distance off target is 1d10 × 1d10 percent of the distance that was to be traveled. For example, if you tried to travel 120 miles, landed off target, and rolled a 5 and 3 on the two d10s, then you would be off target by 15 percent, or 18 miles. The DM determines the direction off target randomly by rolling a d8 and designating 1 as north, 2 as northeast, 3 as east, and so on around the points of the compass. If you were teleporting to a coastal city and wound up 18 miles out at sea, you could be in trouble.</p><p><strong>Similar Area</strong>. You and your group (or the target object) wind up in a different area that's visually or thematically similar to the target area. If you are heading for your home laboratory, for example, you might wind up in another wizard's laboratory or in an alchemical supply shop that has many of the same tools and implements as your laboratory. Generally, you appear in the closest similar place, but since the spell has no range limit, you could conceivably wind up anywhere on the plane.</p><p><strong>Mishap</strong>. The spell's unpredictable magic results in a difficult journey. Each teleporting creature (or the target object) takes 3d10 force damage, and the DM rerolls on the table to see where you wind up (multiple mishaps can occur, dealing damage each time).</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"PHB pg. 281","activation":{"type":"action","cost":1,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":null,"units":"inst"},"target":{"value":9,"width":null,"units":"","type":"creature"},"range":{"value":10,"long":0,"units":"ft"},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":""},"consume":{"type":"","target":"","amount":null},"ability":"","actionType":"util","attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":{"threshold":null,"damage":""},"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":"","value":""},"formula":"1d100","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell","value":""},"level":7,"school":"con","components":{"value":"","vocal":true,"somatic":false,"material":false,"ritual":false,"concentration":false},"materials":{"value":"","consumed":false,"cost":0,"supply":0},"preparation":{"mode":"prepared","prepared":true},"scaling":{"mode":"none","formula":""},"attunement":0},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":100001,"permission":{"default":0},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.dnd5e.spells.L4J89JXqbKs6puEV"}}},{"_id":"vgTunE3gLps5Q595","name":"Dagger","type":"weapon","img":"icons/weapons/daggers/dagger-jeweled-purple.webp","data":{"description":{"value":"<section class=\"secret\">\n<p>Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target.

first time you see those hollow sockets staring back at you with some semblance of thought inside the skull, I advise to quash any feelings of accomplishment.  The skeletal servant you have raised is little more than a brainless husk.  Without proper, and I mean proper, instruction, the bones in front of you might as well have remained dusty upon the floor.  Explain the orders carefully and lay out the steps of your new servant's tasks with exceeding care.  Also, should you catch your skeletal friend partaking in the activities of their former life, do not scold them.  The mundane routine of chopping wood or swinging a hammer can allow for more malleable servants as time continues.<br /><em>The Book of Dark Servants, Vol III.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Skeletons are beings raised into undeath by the will of necromantic magic.  The necromantic magics used within the ritual can either be cast by a trained hand or simply seep into the bones of the skeleton in areas of concentrated death.  Cemeteries, catacombs, and battle fields are all subject to the sporadic rising of skeletons into their new lives.  The magic not only keeps the skeleton “living”, but it also binds joints and bones together like spectral ligaments.  With its second life, the skeleton acts as a semi-mindless creature serving its master's will.</p>\n<p><strong>Spooky Scary.</strong> For the up and coming necromancer, skeletons make worthy guards for a hidden repository of forbidden knowledge.  Skeletons will follow simple to mildly complex orders given (such as forming a protective circle or constructing minor defenses) without the necromancer needing to worry about the durability of their creations.  The skeletons will avoid danger and refuse to injure themselves unless explicitly ordered by their master.  Skeletons do seem to grow rather bored without direction and have been observed ambling around an area performing simple actions from their past lives.  One notable skeleton I recall was still able to cast their fishing line, though clumsily at best, into the nearby lake.  Skeletons, however, are not utilized for their prior skills but as guardians of the necromancer who summoned them back from the hells.  Skeletons are more than capable when swinging a sword or firing a crossbow, finding martial prowess in death that they may have lacked in life thanks to the dark power flowing through their marrow.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Author's Note: Not all skeletal adversaries in an adventurer's journey will be humanoid.  Be wary, as significant magics can summon back more powerful skeletal monsters.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Token artwork by Forgotten Adventures.</em></li>\n<li><em>Bestiary entry by Penelope

upwards of 700 pounds, elk are the largest species of deer found within the natural world.  To the untrained eye, elk simply look much like a gigantic deer as males retain the characteristic pronged antlers (females bearing none) as their smaller cousins.  There are, however, a few differences between the two creatures.  The most notable difference is in vocalization as elk favor a series of bugles or shrieks which echo loudly throughout the forest.  These bugling vocalizations signal the arrival of mating season (called a rut) in which dominant males will battle between themselves with sharpened antlers for a female's favor.  Should you hear the keening cry of the elk in a silent forest, may I advise you that you should best turn back lest you are ready for a pheromone addled fight

Steele could still see it even with his eyes squeezed shut. A mysterious letter. Breaking into the warehouse following clues. A crazed cultist. The flash of a dagger. Blood. His partner Danvers dead in his arms.</p>\n<p>\"Look,\" the captain said, \"just take some time off. Give this whole incident time to blow over. In a few months we can bring you back on probation. Maybe it'll be good for you. You can work on your painting.

He needed a drink.</p>\n<p>\"Hey,\" the captain said as he put his hand on Steele's shoulder, \"take it easy on the sauce, Steele.

You learn more ki features as you gain levels in this class.</p><p>When you spend a ki point, it is unavailable until you finish a short or long rest, at the end of which you draw all of your expended ki back into yourself. You must spend at least 30 minutes of the rest meditating to regain your ki points.</p><p>Some of your ki features require your target to make a saving throw to resist the feature's effects.

You and your group (or the target object) appear where you want to.</p><p><strong>Off Target</strong>. You and your group (or the target object) appear a random distance away from the destination in a random direction. Distance off target is 1d10 × 1d10 percent of the distance that was to be traveled. For example, if you tried to travel 120 miles, landed off target, and rolled a 5 and 3 on the two d10s, then you would be off target by 15 percent, or 18 miles. The DM determines the direction off target randomly by rolling a d8 and designating 1 as north, 2 as northeast, 3 as east, and so on around the points of the compass. If you were teleporting to a coastal city and wound up 18 miles out at sea, you could be in trouble.</p><p><strong>Similar Area</strong>. You and your group (or the target object) wind up in a different area that's visually or thematically similar to the target area. If you are heading for your home laboratory, for example, you might wind up in another wizard's laboratory or in an alchemical supply shop that has many of the same tools and implements as your laboratory. Generally, you appear in the closest similar place, but since the spell has no range limit, you could conceivably wind up anywhere on the plane.</p><p><strong>Mishap</strong>. The spell's unpredictable magic results in a difficult journey. Each teleporting creature (or the target object) takes 3d10 force damage, and the DM rerolls on the table to see where you wind up (multiple mishaps can occur, dealing damage each time).</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"PHB pg. 281","activation":{"type":"action","cost":1,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":null,"units":"inst"},"target":{"value":9,"width":null,"units":"","type":"creature"},"range":{"value":10,"long":0,"units":"ft"},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":""},"consume":{"type":"","target":"","amount":null},"ability":"","actionType":"util","attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":{"threshold":null,"damage":""},"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":"","value":""},"formula":"1d100","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell","value":""},"level":7,"school":"con","components":{"value":"","vocal":true,"somatic":false,"material":false,"ritual":false,"concentration":false},"materials":{"value":"","consumed":false,"cost":0,"supply":0},"preparation":{"mode":"prepared","prepared":true},"scaling":{"mode":"none","formula":""},"attunement":0},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":100001,"permission":{"default":0},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.dnd5e.spells.L4J89JXqbKs6puEV"}}},{"_id":"S5AeLTegixmkt9DE","name":"Mind Blank","type":"spell","img":"systems/dnd5e/icons/spells/air-burst-sky-3.jpg","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>Until the spell ends, one willing creature you touch is immune to psychic damage, any effect that would sense its emotions or read its thoughts, Divination Spells, and the Charmed condition.
