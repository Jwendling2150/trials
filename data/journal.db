{"_id":"T0dkNYJSzTJNbwyL","name":"Homestead","content":"<p>You come to awareness as if stepping out of a fog.</p>\n<p>As your thoughts begin to clear you realize that you are standing on the edge of a cliff staring out over a misty landscape. A gentle stream flows down from the mountain raising behind you and rushes off the edge of the cliff, adding a harmony to what seems like an otherwise a queit morning. It is cold, in fact quite cold. This is due, in part, to the fact that you are naked.</p>\n<p>Looking around you find that you are not alone on the cliff face. Several others stand near you. They are also naked. </p>\n<p>A new sound encroaches on the quiet morning as you hear a door opening somewhere behind you. </p>\n<p>\"My my,\" a gruff voice says, \"I see it was an eventful evening.\" </p>\n<p>An elderly looking Dragonborn steps out from what appears to be a hallow carved into the base of an enormous tree. He walks over to the edge of the cliff and stand beside you looking out over the misty landscape. </p>\n<p>\"A misty morning today,\" he says, then chuckles to himself as if this was a joke. He then turns to regard the group on his doorstep. \"I trust your trip was not overly taxing,\" he says, and then chuckles to himself again. \"Well come on then, let's get you some clothes. You're probably feeling a little less than comfortable at the moment.\"</p>\n<p>He then turns and walks back towards his home.</p>\n<p>\"You may call me Akra, if you feel the need,\" he calls back over his shoulder.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Questions:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Where are we:</strong></p>\n<p>Look kid, I can answer your questions while you're standing naked on my front yard, or I can answer them inside, sitting by the fire with a cup of stew, and to be honest, I prefer to sit down.\"</p>\n<p>Alright then so here's the thing: you're dead. <span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Beyond the veil, so to speak. Some of the more poetic of us call this side, the Veillands.</span><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\"> I wouldn't worry too much if you can't remeber how it happend, lot's of folks who come through this way have that problem. It's often not a pleasant experience. Easier on the mind to just, let it go. You'll find you want to go easy on the mind in this place.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Why am I naked:</strong></p>\n<p>Because you haven't picked a set of clothes yet, which, at this point is on you. As for why you showed up here naked, the only thing that you carry into death is yourself. Your soul doesn't see your clothes as part of you and that's all that matters. </p>\n<p><strong>Where did you get all this stuff from:</strong></p>\n<p>Funny thing about that. Turns out I have something of a talent on this side. Soulforger they call me. I'm lead to believe it is somewhat rare. I can take bits of souls, mine or those of others, and recreate things from the real world. Everyone here always wants something, and when they do, they come to me. Can be damn inconvenient most of the time, but it makes me something of a neutral party so folks don't bother me too much... plus it is good to be needed. Helps keep the head on straight if you have something to do. </p>\n<p><strong>Who are you/How long have you been here:</strong></p>\n<p>Don't rightly know. <span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Lots of things tend to fade when you're in here for a while. Based on the robes and divine symbols (gestures at the amulet around his neck) that are stashed all over this place, I'm </span><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">pretty sure I was a holy man of some kind, but I couldn't tell you for who or what. The memory loss tends to get to people most on this side. Folks either pass on or lose their marbles eventually.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Why do people go crazy:</strong></p>\n<p>What you have to understand is that nothing here is real. You're dead. That thing you think is your body, the words you think you are hearing, the air you think you are breathing, it's all created by your mind to explain what you are experiencing. It's true of everything here, though it may be more accurate to say it is created collectively by all of our minds. Don't think that means you can go imagining your way out of problems though. The mind is tougher to convince than that, especially when it wants to fool itself, and that's before you even consider that you would not only need to convince yourself but also everyone else in here at the same time. But this place does act in ways that are not entirely logical and many find that to be quite unsettling given time. You don't need to eat, for example, or sleep, though I would recommend doing both. These things help you remeber your living life and keep you grounded in that. Ignoring them will drive ya nuts faster. </p>\n<p><strong>Why are we here:</strong></p>\n<p>My best guess, unresolved issues. Something you didn't get to do, or something you regret. whatever it is it's keeping your soul from moving on.</p>\n<p><strong>What is beyond:</strong></p>\n<p>In life I might have told you that God is beyond this place, or perhaps gods. Now, I'm not sure. Death has been surprisingly more vacant of the divine than one might have expected.</p>\n<p><strong>Will you come with us:</strong></p>\n<p>Hell no. Any path you take beyond this homestead will be hard and uncomfortable and I've finally got this place feeling pretty good after I literally don't know how long. I'm good. Besides, you are probably going to have a lot of violence ahead of you and... well I'm not going to be a part of that, so sorry no. This is where I belong. I think... I think it's what I deserve.</p>\n<p><strong>Will you help us:</strong></p>\n<p>Yes. In my way. I can tell you about the Veillands, and if you find yourselves in real trouble, you are welcome back here. It's the same offer I extend to anyone who finds themselves at my door. Though most eventually deicde there are other places they want to be.</p>\n<p><strong>Is there a way out of here:</strong></p>\n<p>Yes indeed. Through quiet and peaceful meditation you can come to terms with whatever has brought you here, and that will allow your soul to find rest. At that point, you'll simply fade from this place and go... whereever is next. We can begin now if you would like. It's easy, just sit quietly and don't move.</p>\n<p>... There... may be another way. I've never seen it. Only heard tales from others who were here before me. Some kind of path, or gateway. I have no idea where it is, but supposedly it can guide you back to the land of the living. I am guessing it's not easy to find, nor easy to use if you do find it. Death is something of a permanent condition for most folks. </p>\n<p><strong>What can you tell us about the area:</strong></p>\n<p>Right now you're sitting in my homestead. There are two ways to head from here. Going east will take you through Viletooth Gully while going West takes you down Old One Eye's Path (don't ask me why they call it that). If you head East, you won't find much in the gully other than harpy nests, but the gully has paths to the highlands if you continue East and passage to archmage Loqumon's tower to the north. My advice, avoid Loqumon. The passage is dangerous and Loqumon is as mad as they come.</p>\n<p>Now, the highlands have paths going North and East. If you continue east through the highlands you will come to the Dragonrider's encampment. North take's you to the mountain's throne. <span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">The mountain's throne is ruled over by an ancient storm giant who is keen to leave alone when left alone.</span><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\"> The Dragonriders, on the other hand, are among the more organzied and sane of the groups in here, though don't expect kindness as a result. They are ruthless brutalizers who prey on the weak as they arrive and grow their numbers by recruiting the most aggressive and hateful who pass through here. They are fairly well equipped too and they have their beasts, though I don't think any of them individually is particularly strong. Oh, and if you do ever meet them, don't point out that they ride Wyverns and not Dragons. It's something of a sore spot.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">If you head West instead, through One Eye's path, you can follow it down towards the base of this mountain. From there you can head North towards the Titan's Gate, not sure what's past that big ass door, or you can go South towards the crypt of the three kings. I don't really get down off the mountain much, so I'm not sure what's past the three kings. You'll eventually get to the coast, but beaches were never really my thing. Oh and a word of warning, I would not continue West on One Eye's path. That will take you straight to the territory of the Black Council. They aren't exactly as terrifying as they make themselves out to be, but they are ambitious and utterly without morals, so they seem like a bunch of pretentious assholes to me. </span></p>\n<p> </p>","folder":"syTU6LfeSHtWgKYt","sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"vmPmArlBOnlDRCNW":3},"flags":{}}
